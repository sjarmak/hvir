# GitHub project management

hvir uses [GitHub Project 1](https://github.com/users/jarmak-personal/projects/1) as its
canonical planning Project. Issues are the planning records; repository labels remain the
source of truth for categorical metadata.

## Categorical metadata

Every open issue should have exactly one recognized `kind:*` label and may have any number of
`area:*` labels. Kind labels are projected one way into the Project's exclusive `Kind`
single-select field:

| Repository label | Project option |
| --- | --- |
| `kind:epic` | `Epic` |
| `kind:feature` | `Feature` |
| `kind:bug` | `Bug` |
| `kind:refactor` | `Refactor` |
| `kind:docs` | `Docs` |
| `kind:maintenance` | `Maintenance` |
| `kind:enhancement` | `Enhancement` |

The `Kind` field is useful for exclusive grouping and charts. It is derived data: changing it
in the Project does not change repository labels, and the next reconciliation overwrites drift.

Area labels stay multi-valued and are not flattened into a custom field. Project views use
GitHub's native boolean filtering. For example, the saved
[Feature requests · Terminal](https://github.com/users/jarmak-personal/projects/1/views/3)
view uses:

```text
is:open AND (label:"kind:feature" OR label:"kind:enhancement") AND label:"area:terminal"
```

## Kind policy

- Adding a recognized kind makes that label authoritative and removes other `kind:*` labels.
- Removing the sole recognized kind restores it. Add the replacement kind first when changing
  classification.
- Creating or reopening an issue without a kind reports an error; automation does not guess.
  Because issue creation is maintainer-only and blank issue creation is disabled, a kindless
  `opened` event intentionally fails its workflow run. Applying a recognized kind triggers a
  succeeding reconciliation.
- Manual reconciliation reports missing, unsupported, and competing kinds without choosing one.
- Open issues are added or restored in the canonical Project when needed. Their Kind is derived
  from the repository label, and blank or stale completed Status values converge to `Todo`.
- Closed issues with an active Project item retain their label-derived Kind and converge to
  `Done`. Reopening converges them back to open-work planning before PR relationships are applied.
- A delayed event whose issue timestamp is older than current GitHub state is treated as a
  non-destructive reconciliation, not replayed as a label transition.

## Repository interface

### Kind reconciliation

The repository-owned kind command defaults to a dry run:

```sh
npm run project:kind -- --issue 83
npm run project:kind
```

Pass `--apply` only after reviewing the report:

```sh
npm run project:kind -- --issue 83 --apply
npm run project:kind -- --apply
```

The command reads credentials only from `HVIR_REPO_TOKEN` and `HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN`. It never
accepts tokens as command-line arguments or logs IDs, tokens, raw API responses, issue titles,
or issue bodies. For a local maintainer run, the existing GitHub CLI credential can be supplied
without writing it to disk:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run project:kind -- --issue 83
```

The command prints one concise result by default. Use `--verbose` for per-issue human diagnostics
or `--json` for the structured report. It exits nonzero when any issue is missing a kind or has
ambiguous kind metadata. GitHub API failures, missing fields/options, irreconcilable closed-item
membership, permission errors, and exhausted bounded retries also fail visibly.

### Normalized planning records

An agent or maintainer can read one issue and its canonical Project state without knowing
GitHub node IDs, Project item IDs, field IDs, option IDs, or GraphQL unions:

```sh
npm run project:record -- --issue 85
```

The structured JSON record contains only repository and issue identity, open/closed state,
recognized kind metadata, sorted multi-valued `area:*` labels, native parent/sub-issue
relationships, native linked pull requests, Project membership, and named `Kind` and `Status`
values. It deliberately omits issue and pull-request titles, bodies, comments, and internal
GitHub IDs. Native pull-request relationships are reported as `closing` unless GitHub reports
them as manually `linked`; closed and merged pull requests remain visible.

Project membership has three explicit states:

- `missing`: the issue has no item in the canonical Project;
- `archived`: its canonical item exists but is archived; and
- `present`: its canonical item exists and is active.

A read never changes membership. Add or restore an eligible open issue only by requesting the
named operation; it remains a dry run unless `--apply` is also present:

```sh
npm run project:record -- --issue 85 --ensure-project
npm run project:record -- --issue 85 --ensure-project --apply
```

`Status` is the only writable planning value. The command accepts the canonical option names
`Todo`, `In Progress`, and `Done`, skips an existing value, and reports its operation as
`would-update`, `updated`, or `unchanged`:

```sh
npm run project:record -- --issue 85 --status 'In Progress'
npm run project:record -- --issue 85 --status 'In Progress' --apply
```

Setting Status on a missing or archived item requires `--ensure-project`, so membership intent
cannot be inferred from a field update. Missing or archived closed issues cannot be added or
restored. Direct Project `Kind` writes are rejected because repository labels remain its owner.
Apply operations are sequential, not transactional: if add/restore succeeds and a later Status
write fails, the membership change remains and a retry resumes idempotently from current state.

On a successful apply, the command re-reads the item and `record` reflects the confirmed Project
values. In dry-run output, `record` remains the observed state and `operations` describes the
proposed changes. A valid read, dry run, applied update, or no-op exits 0. Invalid input, missing
repository/Project access, schema drift, archived/missing mutation intent, GraphQL failures, and
exhausted bounded retries exit 1 with an actionable diagnostic.

The planning-record and kind commands share the same bounded GitHub request, pagination,
repository-owned canonical Project configuration, schema-validation, item-lookup, and
token-redaction mechanics. Per-issue operations resolve membership through the issue's own
Project-items connection and match the stored canonical Project ID. A bulk kind reconciliation
still enumerates the complete canonical Project because the Project membership is its input.
Each command remains one process per consumer operation; lookup and mutation steps are not
separate runner jobs.

Both commands use `HVIR_REPO_TOKEN`, `HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN`, `HVIR_REPOSITORY`,
`HVIR_PROJECT_OWNER`, and `HVIR_PROJECT_NUMBER` as documented above. Credentials are read only
from the environment and are never accepted as command-line values.

### Contributor status

Read the three compact facts; use an exact PR selector when known:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:status -- --issue 757 --pr 758
```

Add `--json` only for detailed structured facts. Status reports Tokens, Project, and Acceptance
independently. Missing Project credentials or token evidence does not suppress repository facts.
Ambiguous relationships and stale checks remain explicit. For a selected child PR, the existing
strict `Completes-child` parser and native parent/epic base prove the relationship; a PR selector
alone is not issue acceptance. A deleted epic branch may leave historical integration unproven.

### Session token capture

The canonical Project has three numeric token fields:

- **Planning tokens:** observed drafting, refinement, and planning-review usage.
- **Implementation tokens:** all observed non-planning usage, including testing, code review,
  corrections, coordination, and acceptance work.
- **Total tokens:** all recorded usage, including contributions whose phase is unknown.

Planning handoffs must request capture or report the explicit reason it is unavailable. For
one issue, plan and apply:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:status -- --issue 776 --capture codex --phase planning

HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:status -- --issue 776 --capture codex --phase planning --apply
```

For issues produced together, add `--issues 776,777` once and select one of those issues with
`--issue`. The tool divides the newly observed integer count equally; ascending issue numbers
receive rounding remainders. A 1,000-token session gives two issues 500 each. Repeated captures
allocate only new usage. End the planning session at the issue-creation handoff, including a
batch. If the session continues and produces another issue, the later issue receives the new
counter difference; existing allocations remain unchanged.

For non-planning work, use `--phase implementation`. Such capture remains optional. If the
session mixes planning and implementation without a reliable split, use `--phase unknown`:
the total survives and both phase fields remain empty. Never infer a whole session's phase
from its latest activity. Missing provider counters remain unknown, not zero. A fully
attributed total equals Planning tokens plus Implementation tokens.

Codex uses the exact current `CODEX_THREAD_ID`; Claude requires `HVIR_USAGE_SESSION_ID` and
`--capture claude-code`. `HVIR_USAGE_CWD` privately identifies the launch directory when it differs
from the worktree. Never substitute a coordinator's identity for a delegate. Unavailable counters
or unpublished issue identities produce a reason rather than fabricated records or a recovery task.

Private assignment and immutable allocation intervals live under the application user's
`.local/state/hvir/contributor-tokens` with private permissions. Tooling commits each interval
before publishing any shares; uncertain appends replay the same opaque contribution identities.
Concurrent allocation claims fail visibly and can be retried. Counter decreases fail closed.
Keep this private state for recapture; cross-machine deduplication recovery is unsupported.
No provider identity, transcript, artifact path, or private lookup digest is published.

Unedited closed-schema receipts authored by the repository owner provide public token evidence.
V3 receipts record allocated phase contributions; V2 cumulative receipts remain readable with
unknown phases, and later observations exclude their already recorded range. Migration evidence
preserves historical contributions and exact covered receipt maxima. Later captures add only
uncovered counts. An epic aggregates its own contributions and every native direct child's once;
never add child Project rows to an already aggregated epic row. Unrecorded work stays unknown.

### Historical token migration

The migration replaces the retired rename-only command. It inventories all Project items using
both archived states, without excluding closed issues. It preserves original measurement values
in durable migration receipts before changing fields. Lifecycle tokens is the authoritative
historical rollup: never add its component phases to it. Recoverable non-planning counts combine
implementation, review, and coordination evidence. Trusted V1 counter records provide additional
recovery, with exact supersession and additive-counter semantics. Missing splits remain unknown;
individually known historical phase values can be retained when the other phase is missing.

Use the verified tooling at deployment, with old token writers quiescent. Capture and retain the
original evidence file, then inspect the offline dry run:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:migrate-tokens -- --snapshot > token-migration-evidence.json

npm run --silent project:migrate-tokens < token-migration-evidence.json
```

The plan lists transfers, unresolved discrepancies, field renames, and exact deletion IDs/names.
It makes no writes. Historical/receipt overlap is never guessed. Where evidence cannot prove
ownership or a split, the snapshot's `corrections` array accepts an explicit migration exception:

```json
{
  "issue": 776,
  "totals": { "planning": null, "implementation": null, "tokens": 1050 },
  "evidence": "Cite the original field/receipt evidence and explain the overlap correction."
}
```

Correction totals are the issue's reconciled **own** baseline, including the snapshot's covered
receipts. For an epic they exclude all direct-child contributions. Missing values are `null`.
Do not edit original source values or receipt histories to make a discrepancy disappear. Repeat
the dry run after documenting corrections. Preserve the original evidence for retries and review.

Once the complete plan reconciles, apply transfers; source comparison is recomputed against
GitHub, and changed membership, relationships, fields, or values fail visibly:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:migrate-tokens -- --apply < token-migration-evidence.json
```

After reviewing the exact deletion targets and successful reconciliation, repeat with `--delete`:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:migrate-tokens -- --apply --delete < token-migration-evidence.json
```

The tool rechecks durable evidence and replacement values before deleting only the named retired
fields. Planning tokens and Implementation tokens retain their existing numeric field IDs;
Recorded tokens becomes Total tokens. Kind, Status, and native fields remain. No new numeric fields
are provisioned. Interrupted transfers and deletions retry against the same saved evidence without
adding totals twice. Preserve evidence even after deletion. Current capture refuses an unmigrated
schema rather than overwriting legacy phase fields. Run `project:audit` after deployment.

### Delivery context

Read the complete implementation context for one issue before selecting a base or worktree:

```sh
npm run issue:context -- --issue 168
npm run issue:context -- --issue 168 --json
```

The command uses the same repository and Project environment values as `project:record`.
The concise human output is the default. The JSON form reports the issue, native parent, ordinary
or epic-child path, exact expected PR base, deterministic `agent/issue-N` branch and sibling
worktree, related open PRs, canonical planning state, and actionable conflicts. The command exits
2 when a conflict blocks safe delivery. It never mutates repository or Project state.

For ordinary issues the expected PR base is `main`; implementation starts from `origin/main`.
For a direct child of an open `kind:epic`, the expected base is the one unambiguous live
`epic/<parent>-<slug>` branch. Missing or multiple branches, nested epics, closed or invalid
parents, mismatched Project state, and open related PRs on the wrong base are explicit conflicts.
The report omits bodies, comments, credentials, internal IDs, and raw API responses.
When invoked from the primary checkout or deterministic sibling issue worktree, the command
infers the primary root without running Git. Set `HVIR_PRIMARY_ROOT` only for a nonstandard local
layout.

### Issue startup

Plan and apply the complete ordinary or epic-child implementation setup through one command:

```sh
npm run issue:start -- --issue 168
npm run issue:start -- --issue 168 --apply
npm run issue:start -- --issue 168 --json
```

Every mode first runs `git fetch --prune origin`, then reads fresh delivery context and local Git
state. That ref refresh is planning mode's only mutation. Planning prints the worktree cleanup,
selection, and dependency operations it would perform without changing any local branch,
worktree, dependency tree, or Project value. Apply recomputes the plan rather than applying a
stored result.

Ordinary issues start at current `origin/main`. Direct epic children start at the one current
`origin/epic/<parent>-<slug>` ref selected by delivery context. A missing or ambiguous epic branch
is a conflict; this command never creates or pushes an epic branch. The selected local branch is
`agent/issue-N`, and its path is the deterministic sibling
`<primary-repository>-worktrees/issue-N`.

Cleanup is limited to exact workflow-owned issue branches and sibling paths. It preserves the
invoking worktree, locked or prunable registrations, tracked or untracked changes, unrecognized
ignored content, live or unproven upstreams, incomplete PR evidence, nonmatching merged heads,
and branches with open PRs. Eligible cleanup uses exact `git worktree remove` and compare-and-
delete `git update-ref` operations without force or recursive filesystem deletion. Retained
unrelated state is reported and does not block startup unless it collides with the selected branch
or path.

Apply creates or reuses the exact selected worktree, then runs `npm ci` with streamed output,
interrupt handling, and a 15-minute timeout. Failed network, installer, native-rebuild, timeout,
or other npm outcomes retain the worktree for an in-place retry. The report lists operations that
already completed; it never rolls back by deleting uncertain state.

Human output is the default. JSON reports only bounded issue and delivery identity, selected HEAD,
dependency state, operations, retained state, conflicts, and operational failures. It excludes
issue and PR prose, credentials, internal GitHub IDs, and raw API responses. Exit code 0 means a
successful plan, apply, or idempotent reuse; 2 means a safe-delivery conflict; and 1 means an
operational or partial-apply failure. After successful setup, apply sets the selected issue's
Status to In Progress through the existing Status owner. Dry runs and failed setup do not mutate
Status; startup never changes Project membership or Kind.

### Final pull-request acceptance

`hvir-merge-pr` treats the maintainer's explicit invocation as merge approval and requests
GitHub's protected merge directly:

```sh
gh pr merge 190 --merge --auto
```

The command never uses `--admin`. The `main` ruleset, required checks, review requirements, base
freshness, and GitHub mergeability remain authoritative. Repository tooling does not duplicate
those policies in a second dry-run merge coordinator.

After GitHub records the merge, the skill resolves one same-repository native closing issue and
uses the existing focused interfaces to converge Project state:

```sh
HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run project:record -- --issue 85 --ensure-project --status Done --apply

HVIR_REPO_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" \
npm run --silent project:status -- --issue 85 --pr <pr>
```

These operations report existing facts and create no merge-phase usage. A failed Project write does not roll back a successful merge and is retried through
only the focused owner that failed. Epic-child pull requests remain integrated by
`hvir-implement-epic`, while ordinary and cumulative root-epic pull requests share this final
acceptance path.

## Pull request relationships and Status

Issues remain the canonical planning records; pull requests are relationship and lifecycle
signals and do not need to be Project items. A PR can relate to same-repository issues in three
explicit ways:

- GitHub's native closing references (`Closes #86`, `Fixes #86`, and their documented keyword
  equivalents) mean that the PR completes the issue. Automation consumes GitHub's resolved
  `closingIssuesReferences`; it does not re-parse closing keywords.
- An exact whole-line `Contributes-to: #N` trailer means that the PR contributes work without
  completing the issue. Multiple trailers are allowed:

  ```text
  Contributes-to: #50
  Contributes-to: #87
  ```
- An epic-child PR uses one exact whole-line `Completes-child: #N` trailer. Automation derives
  the child's open direct epic parent from the native relationship, resolves the one matching
  epic branch, and requires the PR to target that exact base.

The contribution spelling and capitalization are deliberate. Up to three leading spaces and
trailing whitespace are accepted, but the remainder of the line must be exactly
`Contributes-to: #N`, where `N` is a positive same-repository issue number other than the PR
number. Free-form prose, fenced or indented code examples, and HTML comments are ignored.
Malformed, cross-repository, and self-referencing relationships are errors; duplicate
contribution trailers are deduplicated with a warning. A completing-child relationship must name
one direct child exactly once. If one issue is both a completion and contribution target,
completion semantics take precedence.

Status ownership follows the canonical issue and PR signals:

| Current event or state | Related issue behavior |
| --- | --- |
| PR opened, reopened, draft, or ready for review | An eligible open `Todo` issue advances to `In Progress`. |
| Relationship added or edited | Current GitHub relationships are recomputed; eligible targets advance. |
| Ordinary completion PR merged to `main` | Native issue closure owns completion; the issue event converges Project `Done`. |
| Completing-child PR opened against its exact epic base | The direct child and derived parent epic converge to `In Progress`. |
| Completing-child PR merged after exact validation | Trusted automation closes the direct child; the same lifecycle policy converges Project `Done`. |
| Contribution PR merged | The contributed issue stays open and advances from `Todo` to `In Progress` when needed. |
| PR closed unmerged or contribution removed | Current relationships are recomputed, but Status is never automatically regressed. |
| Issue reopened | Current open completion, completing-child, and contribution relationships are recomputed before any advance. |

Normal issue and PR events converge Project membership, label-derived Kind, and lifecycle Status.
Open work starts at `Todo`, active explicit PR relationships advance it to `In Progress`, and
closed issue state owns `Done`. Removing or closing a PR relationship never demotes an already
open `In Progress` issue. Missing or archived open items are added or restored; a closed issue
without an active item is a visible conflict because automation cannot safely invent historical
membership. Multiple PRs for one issue and one PR for multiple issues are resolved from current
GitHub state rather than replaying event assumptions.

Epic-child PRs target a bounded `epic/**` branch and use one `Completes-child: #N` trailer. The
trusted relationship workflow derives the parent epic and advances both records while the PR is
active. After merge, it revalidates the exact base and native parent before closing the child.
Failed or ambiguous validation leaves the child open and reports the conflict. Reopen the child if
a correction makes its outcome incomplete; a new completing-child PR advances eligible reopened
work normally. `Contributes-to: #N` remains available for partial, non-completing work. No
intermediate Project Status is used.

Inspect a PR relationship reconciliation without mutation:

```sh
npm run project:pr -- --pull-request 86
```

Apply the eligible transitions after reviewing the report:

```sh
npm run project:pr -- --pull-request 86 --apply
```

Reconciliation emits one concise line by default. Add `--verbose` for per-target diagnostics or
`--json` for the complete structured report.

A reopened issue can be reconciled directly with `--issue N`. On an edited event, the workflow
passes the previous body through an environment value only so the command can report a removed
contribution; it always queries the current PR, issue relationships, open PR bodies, and Project
record before deciding. Reports contain issue/PR numbers, named states, fixed diagnostics, and
operation outcomes, but never titles, bodies, comments, tokens, node IDs, or raw API responses.

Valid targets are processed independently and deterministically. A malformed trailer or one
missing, archived, inaccessible, or cross-repository target does not suppress valid transitions
from the same event, but the command exits 2 after printing the complete report so the partial
failure remains visible. Failures before a report can be constructed exit 1. Retrying is
idempotent.

## Project schema provisioning

The custom categorical schema has one single-select field named exactly `Kind`, with the seven
options listed above. A maintainer with Project write access can provision it once with:

```sh
gh project field-create 1 \
  --owner jarmak-personal \
  --name Kind \
  --data-type SINGLE_SELECT \
  --single-select-options 'Epic,Feature,Bug,Refactor,Docs,Maintenance,Enhancement'
```

Runtime automation does not create or silently repair schema. The canonical Project ID, field
IDs, and single-select option IDs are stable, non-secret deployment identity stored in
`scripts/project-management/canonical-project-config.ts`. Update that public contract deliberately
after provisioning or an intentional schema change, then audit it against GitHub:

```sh
HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN="$(gh auth token)" npm run project:audit
```

The named audit compares the configured owner and Project number, Project ID, field ID/name/type,
and exact option ID/name sets. Drift produces an actionable, content-free diagnostic. Ordinary
projection and reconciliation use the stored IDs instead of rediscovering the full schema on
every invocation. Repository, owner, or Project-number environment overrides cannot silently
reuse the canonical IDs for another target; a mismatch fails closed.

The planning-record command expects the canonical Project's `Status` single-select field to
contain `Todo`, `In Progress`, and `Done`; it does not create or rename those options.
Duplicate items for one repository issue fail both planning-record and kind commands visibly
rather than allowing an arbitrary item to win.

The three token fields reuse existing configured IDs through the reviewed historical migration
above. Do not create replacement fields or run the retired rename-only command. Kind and Status
owners validate only their own planning contract; token migration does not change their authority.

## Actions authentication and usage

`.github/workflows/project-kind.yml` has two paths:

- one five-minute job for a relevant issue event; and
- one ten-minute manual job for either a single issue or all open issues.

There is no polling and no runner-per-primitive fan-out. Per-issue concurrency serializes
overlapping event jobs without cancelling an in-flight reconciliation. Reads resolve current
state first, and no-op label or Project mutations are skipped.

`.github/workflows/project-pr-planning.yml` has one event job for the relevant PR lifecycle
events targeting `main` or `epic/**`, or an issue reopen, plus one manual PR reconciliation job.
Event jobs apply automatically; manual dispatch is a dry run unless `apply` is selected. A
repository-wide concurrency group serializes Project Status work without cancelling an in-flight
job. Each event uses one runner. PR events load the current triggering PR and its paginated native
relationships; both PR and issue-reopen paths scan paginated open PR bodies once for current
contribution and completing-child trailers and batch all issue operations inside that job. There
is no polling or runner-per-relationship fan-out.

The workflows' repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` receives only `contents: read`, bounded
`issues: write`, and PR metadata read where required. GitHub does not allow that token to access a
user-owned Project, so Project access uses the `HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN` secret from the
`project-automation` environment. That
environment accepts only the `main` branch. Create a classic personal access token owned by the
Project owner with the GitHub-documented `project` and `repo` scopes, then store it as an
environment secret:

```sh
gh secret set HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN --env project-automation --repo jarmak-personal/hvir
```

After confirming the environment secret exists, remove any repository-scoped copy so a workflow
on another ref cannot bypass the environment boundary:

```sh
gh secret list --env project-automation --repo jarmak-personal/hvir
gh secret delete HVIR_PROJECT_TOKEN --repo jarmak-personal/hvir
```

Rotate the token through the environment's Actions secrets settings. Do not reuse a broader
interactive maintainer token as the secret.

Issue titles, bodies, comments, and label text are treated as data. Event values enter the
command through environment variables rather than generated shell source. Third-party actions
are pinned to full commit SHAs. Both jobs check out `main` explicitly without persisting the
`GITHUB_TOKEN`; manual dispatches from any other ref are rejected.

The PR workflow uses `pull_request_target` because a fork-originated PR must be able to trigger
the user-owned Project mutation. This is a privileged metadata workflow: GitHub loads the
workflow from the default branch, the job checks out only trusted `main`, and it never checks out,
fetches, installs, builds, or executes PR code. The job disables package-manager caching and gives
`GITHUB_TOKEN` read-only `contents` and `pull-requests` access plus bounded `issues: write` access
for validated direct-child closure. The Project credential remains isolated in the main-only
`project-automation` environment; the event's
`GITHUB_REF` remains the default branch even when the PR base is `epic/**`. PR bodies and the
prior-body event value are parsed only as data by static default-branch automation; event values
are passed through environment variables and never interpolated into shell source. External
actions remain pinned to full commit SHAs.
