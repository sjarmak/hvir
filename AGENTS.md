# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI agents working in this repository.

## What is hvir?

**hvir** = **H**arness · **V**iew · **I**nteract · **R**espond.

A lightweight, **view-first** workbench for agentic development: a beautiful code + git
explorer wrapped around the terminals (harnesses like Claude Code / Codex) you actually
like. It is **not an IDE and not an editor** — it's a viewer, tuned for the "I hand off to
agents frequently but stay in the loop" workflow.

The name is the thesis: watch the **harness**, **view** the codebase/git, **interact**
lightly, **respond**. VSCode is more than we want; tmux is too hands-off. hvir sits
between them.

**Read [`docs/design.md`](docs/design.md) before doing substantive work** — it holds the
product philosophy, guardrails, architecture, risk posture, and the linked ADR index.
Start with the index's [read-first constraints](docs/design.md#read-first-constraints), then
read the relevant feature decisions under [`docs/adr/`](docs/adr/README.md). Follow lifecycle
notices and replacement scopes: partial supersession leaves unaffected rules authoritative.

**Implementation and acceptance work is tracked in GitHub issues, commits, and pull
requests.** Do not add progress checklists, status logs, or test-run evidence to ADRs.
[`docs/plan/`](docs/plan/00-overview.md) is frozen historical implementation context, not
an active tracker; do not update its checkboxes or status tables to record new work.

**Start substantive implementation from a governing GitHub issue.** Align on the problem,
product fit, architecture questions, and acceptance there before editing. A PR to `main` uses
`Closes #N`; an epic-child PR uses the exact contribution relationships documented in
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). Broad epics should be decomposed into independently
reviewable child issues.

**Final acceptance is separately authorized.** `hvir-implement-issue` and
`hvir-implement-epic` stop at verified, pushed pull-request handoffs. A maintainer invokes
`hvir-merge-pr` to approve one final pull request; an explicit pull-request number wins, while an
omitted number may reuse only one pull request from the latest verified lifecycle handoff in the
active interaction. The skill requests GitHub's protected merge directly, then uses the focused
Project owners to converge the native closing issue. Epic-child integration remains owned by
`hvir-implement-epic`; ordinary and cumulative final pull requests share the small acceptance
path.

**Do not spend effort drafting or creating an issue without the user's go-ahead.** An agent may
briefly propose using `hvir-create-issue`, but must wait for explicit approval before invoking
it. After drafting, it must show the exact issue and receive separate approval before publishing.

**Use `gh` for ordinary issue and pull-request operations.** When work requires the canonical
Project or repository reconciliation behavior, use the interfaces documented in
[`docs/project-management.md`](docs/project-management.md): `project:record` for Project
membership and Status, `project:kind` for label-derived Kind reconciliation, and `project:pr`
for PR relationships and lifecycle reconciliation. Before implementation, use `issue:context` to
read the normalized issue, parent, base, branch, worktree, planning state, open PRs, and conflicts.
Mutating commands default to dry-run; review the plan before passing `--apply`. Invoke only the
capability the task needs, not every command ceremonially. Final pull-request acceptance is the
deliberate exception: explicit `hvir-merge-pr` invocation is the approval, so it uses GitHub's
normal merge/auto-merge path without a second repository dry run.

**Do not publish a pull request that fails locally runnable checks.** After the final changes,
run `npm run verify` before committing. Push without `--no-verify` so `.githooks/pre-push` runs;
if hooks are not installed, run that hook directly before pushing. Fix failures locally or
report an environment blocker instead of spending CI minutes on a known-bad branch.

## Hard constraints (do not violate without explicit sign-off)

- **No real editing.** "Minor edit + save" only. No LSP, debugger, refactors, extension
  host, task/build system. Editing is the guardrail; *surfacing information is not* —
  read-only telemetry (the v2 "harness viewer") is on-philosophy.
- **Nothing blocks the paint.** Heavy work — git walks, file watching, syntax tokenizing,
  large reads — runs off the render thread (utility processes / workers). The UI is always
  instantly responsive. This is how we earn "lighter than VSCode" (a *feel*, not a byte
  count — Electron's RAM cost is accepted deliberately).
- **The terminal is a swappable pane, not the foundation.** Keep it behind the
  `TerminalPane` interface. Never bet the project on an unstable libghostty API.
- **Respect the seams.** All PTY spawning goes through the **PTY supervisor**; all
  harness-specific behavior (launch flags, resume commands, title conventions) stays
  behind the main-owned **harness provider registry/providers** (the evolved
  `HarnessAdapter` seam); the terminal stays behind **`TerminalPane`**; every
  filesystem/git/PTY/watch operation goes through **`ProjectHost`**
  (`LocalHost`/`SshHost`). Harness quirks never leak past their adapter.

- **Every path is host-qualified.** Paths are `(host, path)` pairs everywhere — no bare
  string paths, even in local-only code. Projects live on hosts; local is just the
  default host. (ADR-010)
- **Smart defaults, exposed controls.** View modes (rendered/source/diff per tab) and
  notifications (focus clears, parents aggregate) follow fixed, visible rules — no
  hidden magic, no special-casing. (ADR-007, ADR-009)

## Stack (see the ADR index in design.md)

- **Shell:** Electron + electron-vite
- **Render layer:** React
- **Code viewer:** CodeMirror 6 + Shiki (Monaco fallback)
- **Git engine:** system `git` binary, off-thread (ADR-005)
- **Terminals:** ghostty-web → libghostty (swappable)
- **Harness integration:** main-owned provider registry + launch profiles (ADR-006/012)
- **Session recovery:** exact provider-owned harness resume, no daemon (ADR-006/012)
- **Workspaces:** project (registered) → worktrees (discovered) (ADR-008)
- **Remote projects:** SSH via `ssh2` behind `ProjectHost`; no remote server (ADR-010)
- **Targets:** Linux (primary), modern macOS (primary). Windows only if incidental.

## Conventions

- Prefer leveraging mature OSS over rebuilding.
- Before adding behavior, trace the current owner and search for equivalent policy or helpers.
  Share stable concepts through narrow, domain-named modules; do not create generic `utils`,
  catch-all `services`, service locators, or new responsibilities in composition roots.
- When making an architectural decision, add one decision-only record under `docs/adr/`
  using its template, then add it to the index in `docs/design.md`. Keep context, decision,
  consequences, and rejected alternatives in the ADR; keep implementation tracking in the
  issue/commit/PR history.
- Keep the non-goals in §2 of the design doc in view — resist "just one more thing."
