# hvir (H-veer)

**H**arness · **V**iew · **I**nteract · **R**espond

A lightweight, view-first workbench for agentic development: a polished code and Git
explorer wrapped around the terminals where Claude Code, Codex, and your shell do the
work.

## Why hvir?

hvir is not an IDE and not an editor. It serves one workflow: _“I hand work to agents
frequently, but I want to stay in the loop.”_ tmux is too hands-off for exploring a
codebase and its history; a full IDE is more than this workflow needs. hvir sits between
them.

- Local and SSH projects are peers, with discovered Git worktrees as warm workspaces.
- Files, rendered Markdown, source, diffs, blame, Changes, History, and the commit graph
  are first-class viewing surfaces.
- Existing clean local branches can be explored from a bounded branch selector; advanced
  Git operations stay in the terminal.
- Multiple shell, Claude Code, and Codex sessions split, recover, resume, and report
  attention without a daemon.
- Compact tabs and floating Rendered/Source/Diff controls keep the viewer focused on
  content instead of chrome.
- Dark/light themes, viewer and terminal splits, three-state pane controls, and
  configurable core shortcuts keep the workbench fluid.
- Heavy filesystem, Git, rendering, watching, and telemetry work stays off the render
  thread.

## Install

Install hvir from npm, then launch it from any directory:

```sh
npm install -g hvir-workbench
hvir
```

Pass a local project folder to open it directly (`hvir .`). The npm launcher supports
Linux x64, Linux arm64, and Apple-silicon macOS. Its first launch visibly prepares the
native application in the user cache and does not write to the npm prefix or require
elevation. Native installers are deliberately not another supported release path; see
[docs/packaging.md](docs/packaging.md).

hvir expects the system `git` binary. Claude Code and Codex launch options use those CLIs
from the selected host's login-shell environment; plain shells work without either.

## Runtime diagnostics

Packaged hvir keeps content-free startup, shutdown, PTY, session-registry, and host-control
events in `runtime-diagnostics.jsonl` under Electron's local user-data directory. That is
normally `~/Library/Application Support/hvir` on macOS and
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/hvir` (or `~/.config/hvir`) on Linux. Older segments use
`runtime-diagnostics.1.jsonl` through `.3.jsonl`; each file is limited to 1 MiB and material
older than seven days is removed. Local and SSH projects share this one local journal, and
hvir never records terminal contents, prompts, credentials, environment values, or project
paths there.

## Feedback and project tracking

Public questions and problem reports belong in the
[Q&A Discussions](https://github.com/jarmak-personal/hvir/discussions/categories/q-a), while
proposals belong in [Ideas](https://github.com/jarmak-personal/hvir/discussions/categories/ideas).
GitHub Issues remain the canonical maintainer planning tracker. New, reopened, or unlocked
issue and pull-request conversations are locked automatically; repository collaborators can
still comment for the create, review, and feedback workflow.

Conversation locking does not make an external pull-request title or body trusted input. Agent
workflows should continue to use the trust-boundary guidance in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Development

Development requires Node 24 or newer; release CI uses Node 24.

Start with the [contributor guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). Substantive implementation is discussed in
a governing issue before code or a pull request; the repository also includes optional,
contributor-only agent skills for creating and implementing issues.

```sh
npm ci
npm run verify
npm run smoke
npm run smoke:capacity
npm run performance:capacity  # controlled machine only
npm run dev
```

`npm ci` downloads Electron and rebuilds native dependencies for Electron's ABI. On a
headless Linux machine, run the Electron smoke under `xvfb-run`. The full Phase 8 release
check is:

```sh
npm run gauntlet
```

Contributors can opt into the repository's pre-push hook:

```sh
npm run hooks:install
```

The hook runs `npm run smoke` using the machine's installed Electron platform and
architecture. Headless Linux uses `xvfb-run` when available. CI reports verification,
Electron correctness, deterministic capacity contracts, and machine-dependent performance
evidence without enforcing quantitative budgets on a hosted runner. `npm run gauntlet` remains
the combined controlled-machine release gate. Use `git push --no-verify` when a deliberate local
bypass is needed.

Build the npm payload for the current supported platform with the matching
`pack:npm:*` script. See the
[performance gauntlet](docs/phase8-performance-gauntlet.md) and
[packaging guide](docs/packaging.md) for release acceptance.

The deliberate boundary remains: hvir may surface rich read-only information and permit
a minor edit-and-save, but it does not grow into an IDE.
